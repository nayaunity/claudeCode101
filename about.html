                <p><strong>I want to build AI that benefits humanity.</strong></p>
                <p>Anthropic's mission to develop safe, beneficial AI systems resonates deeply with me. I believe the future of AI must be built responsibly, with careful attention to alignment, interpretability, and real-world impact.</p>
                <p>I'm drawn to Anthropic because you're not just building powerful models—you're actively researching how to make them trustworthy and aligned with human values.</p>

            <div class="about-column">
                <p>I've spent the past year immersed in the Claude ecosystem—building with Claude Code, exploring MCP integrations, developing RAG pipelines, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Opus 4.5.</p>
                <p>My background combines hands-on AI development with developer advocacy. I understand both the technical depth required to build great AI systems and the communication skills needed to help others succeed with them.</p>
                <p>I've shipped production applications using the Claude API, contributed to open-source AI tooling, and created technical content that has reached hundreds of thousands of developers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-column">
                <p><strong>What I bring:</strong> Deep experience with LLM applications, strong Python and TypeScript skills, passion for AI safety and alignment, and a track record of shipping production-ready code.</p>
                <p><strong>Technical expertise:</strong> Python, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Claude API, RAG pipelines, MCP, vector databases, prompt engineering, AI agent architectures.</p>
                <p><strong>Let's connect:</strong> I'm ready to contribute to Anthropic's mission. Whether it's engineering, developer relations, or research support—I want to help build AI that's safe, beneficial, and transformative.</p>
